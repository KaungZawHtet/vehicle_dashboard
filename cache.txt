This is the mini project that demostrates communication betweeen flutter frontend and c++ backend by using GRPC and protobuf (the alternative solution of capnproto). Check the link for more info.

Mechanistic Explanation

In the drive window,There are 4 buttons  : Stop, Slow, Preserve and Speed Up and 4 indicators in the dashboard.

1. At start, you need to lever up the vehicle. If not, rpm and speed won't go higher.
2. When you click the lever up, speed, rpm and distance passed will go higher. And it consumes more fuel. Temperature increases too.
3. More rpm means more fuel consumption.
4. When you click the preserve button, speed and rpm will be preserved. Fuel Consumption keeps going. So does temperature.
5. Slow down button can reduce rpm and speed. Less rpm means less fuel consumption.
6. The stop button makes rpm and speed zero.
7. At initial state, app gives you 40 litre fuel. Max is 47. In case of zero fuel litre in fuel indicator, you can't drive anymore. Then refill the fuel.

Nothing Special! There is only one button and when you want to fill fuel, just click it.

Whenever You click a button at drive panel, it save the data at frontend side and you can track your driving records. You can edit and delete too.
