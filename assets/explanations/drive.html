<h3>Mechanistic Explanation</h3>

<p>In the drive window,There are 4 buttons : Stop, Slow, Preserve and Speed Up and 4 indicators : rpm indicator,
speedometer, temperature indicator and distance passed recorder.</p>

<ol>
    <li>At start, you need to lever up the vehicle. If not, rpm and speed won't go higher.</li>
    <li>When you click the lever up, speed, rpm and distance passed will go higher. And it consumes more fuel. Temperature
    increases too.</li>
    <li>More rpm means more fuel consumption.</li>
    <li>When you click the preserve button, speed and rpm will be preserved. Depending on rpm, fuel consumption keeps going. So does
    temperature.</li>
    <li>Slow down button can reduce rpm and speed. Less rpm means less fuel consumption.</li>
    <li>The stop button makes rpm and speed zero.</li>
    <li>At initial state, app gives you 40 litre fuel. Max is 47. In case of 0 fuel litre in fuel indicator, you can't
    drive anymore. Then refill the fuel.</li>
</ol>
